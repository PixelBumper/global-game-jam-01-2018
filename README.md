## Tips during development

### Avoiding merge issues in meta files
1. Always create a prefab for each gameobject in the scene
2. Ensure that there is at most one person working on a prefab
3. Ensure that there is at most one person working on each game scene
   * if you need one of the scenes to adjust a prefab, create a copy of that scene
   * save prefabs changes by clicking the apply button

### IDE Recommendation
Use Project Rider :)
